                        I have two of the most adorable and well behaved children ever born.  This is a picture of them doing something they love....eating cupcakes!

                        This one is still a work in progress but I'm sure that eventually it will be 100% true.  I'm already begining to like the parts I understand!

                        "A Pizza Maid"<br>To softly whisper, "...lovely Lisa..."<br>brings dreams of lips so full and red.<br>Which rhymes, of course, with "Garlic Bread".<br>And Lisa assonates with "Piece a Pizza."<br>If you do not speak as good<br>as proper speaking people should.
